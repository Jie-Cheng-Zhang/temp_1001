# 🎉 Welcome to the Official Repo for "Complete Multi-Modal Metric Learning for Multi-Modal Sarcasm Detection"! 

Thanks for stopping by! This is where you'll find the code implementation for our paper *Complete Multi-Modal Metric Learning for Multi-Modal Sarcasm Detection*. We’re keeping it brief for now, but once the paper is published, we'll be rolling out a detailed guide with more goodies! Stay tuned. 📚

## 🚀 Installation Instructions
Let’s get you up and running! Here’s what you need to do:

1. **Download the data**  
   Grab the dataset from ["Multi-Modal Sarcasm Detection in Twitter with Hierarchical Fusion Model"](https://github.com/ZLJ2015106/pytorch-multimodal_sarcasm_detection.git) (it’s a great starting point).

2. **Install the required packages**  
   Before diving into the code, make sure you have the following installed:
   ```bash
   torch == 1.13.0
   torchtext == 0.14.0
   torchvision == 0.14.0
   clip == 1.0
   senticnet == 1.6
   ```
   *Pro Tip*: The object existence vector from yolo v10 is packed inside the `text_data` for you.

## 🛠️ Usage

Once you’ve got everything ready, running the code is as easy as:

```bash
python main.py
```

## 📦 Download the Pre-trained Parameters

The parameter file will be available soon, hosted on Google Drive. Please hold tight while we get things sorted out! 🙏 [wait..]
